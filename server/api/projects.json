      "desc": "A 2D superhero video game targeted towards children which utilizes the technology LeapMotion for hand gesture recognition to enable character movement. Initially the LeapMotion technology was used to enable hand gesture recognition to manipulate the characterâ€™s movement to fly at an angle that's based on the pitch of your hand. The idea of a kid playing with his superman-like action figure by grasping the figures legs and pretending he was soaring through the sky spawned the idea for how the control scheme for the game would work. ", 
      "desc2": "The concept for the game was simple. Play as a superhero soaring through the sky whilst in the pursuit of an evil villain who is relentlessly targeting you whilst you collect coins and power-ups to aid you in your battle to defeat him.  ", 
      "desc3": "The project has been updated to be used within a browser using a mouse to manipulate movement.",
