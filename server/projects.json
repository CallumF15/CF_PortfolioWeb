      "bg": "Initially the LeapMotion technology was used to enable hand gesture recognition to manipulate the characterâ€™s movement to fly at an angle that's based on the pitch of your hand.  The idea of a kid playing with his superman-like action figure by grasping the figures legs and pretending he was soaring through the sky spawned the idea for how the control scheme for the game would work. The project has been updated to be used within a browser using a mouse to manipulate movement.",
